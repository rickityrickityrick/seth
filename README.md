## Modding Guide
Currently, the mod is in a early state. So no modding guide yet, but I'm working on it.

## How did I make this?
If your wondering, .crx files (those are what Chromium browsers use for extensions) are just renamed .zip/rar/7z files.  
So if you have something like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), you can extract the .crx file and get the source.  
And from there you can modify it to your heart's (and your programming skill's) content.

## Why did I upload this to GitHub?
I uploaded this to GitHub since the game wouldn't work if I just ran it on my laptop.   
This is a problem since the game uses .json and many other files, At least Chromium based browsers (I use Microsoft Edge) have this weird thing where you can't access certain things if you run the file locally.    
Due to that, I had to upload the project to GitHub to work.   
TL;DR, Game wouldn't work if I didn't upload it to GitHub.
